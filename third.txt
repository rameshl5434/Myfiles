1.How to define a constructor.
Basically constructor is a method in a class which having the name as same as class.
It doesn't have any return types but have access specifiers-public,private(obj is created inside class),protected.
A constructor in Java is the initiator of an object.
anytime you create a new instance of a class, a constructor is invoked.
If you do not create a constructor, the default constructor (no arguments, no other real code) is created for you by Java.
syntax:class Cls{
	cls()
	{
	-------------
	-------------
`	}
	}
2.How many constructours can be in class
You can define as many constructors as you need.
 When a Java class contains multiple constructors, we say that the constructor is overloaded (comes in multiple versions). 
This is what constructor overloading means, that a Java class contains multiple constructors.

Types of constructors:
1.Default Constructor.
2.No-args Constructor.
3.paramaterised Constructor.


3.Which access specifiers we use with constructour
we can use 3 specifiers.
public private protected
public -access from anywhere.
private-object is created inside the same class and should be accessed from there ie.. not from outside the class.
protected-can be accessed from its own class, its subclasses, all other classes belonging to the same package and subclasses.
